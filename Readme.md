## About
This page is designed as a 3d modeling for a seahawk helicopter, which can translate and rotate based on flexible keyframes. 
This project is purposed by Mr. Billy Greer, under the direction of Prof. Nicholas Polys, and developed @ [VT_VisionariumLab](https://www.arc.vt.edu/visionarium/)

The project has 2 versions, one based on XITE and one based on X3DOM. The XITE version has been working properly while rendered with Chrome.

Throughout the testing phase, the X3DOM version webpage could not switch between cameras correctly, which is likely to be caused by the current version of X3DOM (Dec. 2018).
