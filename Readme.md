## Credits
The original [SH-60 SeaHawk 3d model](https://free3d.com/3d-model/sh-60-seahawk-32184.html) is a free .obj model available at http://free3d.com. It is a product by *pleitosmovies*.

## About
This page is designed as a 3d modeling for a seahawk helicopter, which can translate and rotate based on flexible keyframes. This project is developed @ [VT_VisionariumLab](https://www.arc.vt.edu/visionarium/)

The project is based on X3DOM.

### About the model files
*5xulumjp2ohs-SeaHawk* contains the original .obj model parts, along with the converted .x3d model parts.

*5xulumjp2ohs-SeaHawk/Textures* is the texture dir for the .obj model.

The .x3d files have names that are self-suggestive. However, as the model is animated, only seahawk-body.x3d, seahawk-mainRotor.x3d, and seahawk-tailRotorNew.x3d directly contributes to the project.
*In other words, you only need these 3 files to render the model*

.blend files are intermediate blender files for model manipulation.
